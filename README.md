# Astrelle Sky Simulator

Astrelle is a high-fidelity sky simulation software designed to generate realistic, synthetic astronomical images in the FITS format. It models the entire photon-to-pixel pipeline, from sourcing celestial objects from real-world catalogs to simulating atmospheric effects and detector noise. Its primary purpose is to create ground-truth datasets for the development and validation of algorithms that detect and mitigate satellite trails in astronomical data.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Sky Simulation**: Generates star fields and galaxies sourced from major astronomical catalogs (Gaia DR3, 2MASS XSC).
- **Physical Modeling**: Accurately models atmospheric seeing (PSF), sky background, and detector noise (shot, read, dark current).
- **Satellite Trail Generation**: Simulates both real satellite passes by fetching live TLE data, and allows creation of configurable synthetic trails.
- **Configurable Instruments**: JSON-based preset system defines telescope and sensor combinations.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive GUI built with PyQt6 provides full control over simulation parameters.
- **Standard Data Formats**: Outputs FITS files with valid WCS headers, along with optional PNG images and CSV ground-truth lists.

  - RA: `12h 59m 49s`  
  - Dec: `+27d 58m 50s`  
- **Observation**:  
  - Exposure Time: `300 s`  
  - Seeing: `1.2 arcsec`  
  - Sky Brightness: `22.0 mag/arcsecÂ²`  
- **Satellites**:  
  - Mode: `Synthetic`  
  - Trail Parameters:  
    - Magnitude: `7.0`  
    - Start Pixel (X,Y): `0, 1024`  
    - End Pixel (X,Y): `2048, 1024`

Run the simulation and monitor the log window for progress.
